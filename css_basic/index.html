            <!-- Heading Level 1 (Original Content) -->
            <h1>Introduction to HTML Structure</h1>

            <!-- First Paragraph (Original Content) -->
            <p>
                The HTML document object model (DOM) forms the core structure of any webpage. It starts with the mandatory 
                `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration, which tells the browser which version of HTML to expect. Following this, the 
                `<html>` element wraps all content and usually specifies the document's language using the `lang` attribute.
            </p>

            <!-- Heading Level 2 (Original Content) -->
            <h2>The Importance of Head and Body</h2>

            <!-- Second Paragraph (Original Content) -->
            <p>
                The document is logically divided into two main parts: the `<head>` and the `<body>`. The `<head>` contains 
                metadata—information about the document, such as its title, character set (`<meta charset="UTF-8">`), and 
                links to external stylesheets or scripts. This content is generally not visible to the user but is vital 
                for browser function and search engine optimization.
            </p>

            <!-- Third Paragraph (Original Content) -->
            <p>
                In contrast, the `<body>` contains all the elements that are visually rendered to the user. This includes text, 
                links, images, multimedia, and interactive forms. Proper structuring of the body content is crucial for both 
                readability and accessibility, ensuring a smooth experience for all visitors.
            </p>

            <!-- Heading Level 3 (Original Content) -->
            <h3>Hierarchical Headings and Content Flow</h3>

            <!-- Fourth Paragraph (Original Content) -->
            <p>
                Headings, ranging from `<h1>` (the main topic) down to `<h6>`, establish a clear hierarchy for the document. 
                It is considered best practice to only use a single `<h1>` tag per page to represent the primary theme. 
                Lower-level headings (`<h2>`, `<h3>`, etc.) should be used to organize sub-sections logically, much like 
                chapters and subchapters in a book. This structure greatly aids assistive technologies and content parsers.
            </p>

            <!-- Clickable Image (Original Content) -->
            <p>
                Below is an example of an image that is also a clickable link, demonstrating the use of both the `<a>` and `<img>` tags.
            </p>

                <img src="https://i.ibb.co/gTDZZT8/ALX-Logo-07.png" 
                     alt="ALX Africa Logo"
